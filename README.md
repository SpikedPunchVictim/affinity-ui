# Notes

## Selecting a Context Menu
- [ki-vue](https://github.com/Kiyoaki-w/Ki-vue-context)
  - Too wonky to use
- [hscmap/vue-menu](https://github.com/michitaro/vue-menu)
  - To use in Electron-Vue: https://github.com/michitaro/vue-menu/issues/5#issuecomment-450770617
  - Too wonky to use and to pass down functionality to children 
- [vue-context-element](https://github.com/zacharykeeping/vue-context-element)
  - Poorly documented. Couldn't use.
